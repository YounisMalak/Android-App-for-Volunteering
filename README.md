# Android-App-for-Volunteering

As part of the Design and Implementation of Android Apps course, developed in pairs an android app for a senior living facility to help residents request different services. Volunteers can view these requests and assign themselves. Admin access was given to the volunteer manager with the ability to view, edit, add or remove services, residents, and volunteers. The app was developed using Java. SQLite and Firebase were used for managing data.
